            Woowa really helped us in terms of following up customer payments.
            Very often after a customer makes a purchase, they don&apos;t pay
            immediately and even end up forgetting. Now with Woowa, they always
            get bills automatically via WA and if they haven&apos;t paid yet,
            Woowa can continue to send chain messages. This is great because
            WA&apos;s open rate is up to 95%, far higher than email open rates!
            With Woowa, percentage of paying customers has increased to more
            than 50%!.

            Very helpful, especially in sending notifications invoice because it
            goes directly to our buyer&apos;s WA... it&apos;s cool anyway..üëç
            just choose the pending invoice date berapa, the choice is complete
            until today. after the number of invoices appears, just make a
            template followup then send..joss...it&apos;s increasing
            yesterday&apos;s sales ad display.in 3 hours translucent 20 sales,
            crazy... only 1 the key...Tools Woowa helps improve my product sales
            up to hundreds of sales in 7 days huhuuu.
